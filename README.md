# Network-Management-System
A simple NMS system.
Network Device Management:
The system reads network devices and connection details from provided files (devices.txt and connections.txt) and allows for adding, editing, and removing devices. This component ensures that the network inventory is current and accurately reflects the infrastructure.

Route Management:
Implements an algorithm to calculate and display the optimal path between any two network devices based on the network's topology. This functionality is critical for determining efficient routing and ensuring high network performance.

Logging Management:
Provides robust logging functionality to capture events such as configuration changes and route updates. Logs are output to the console and/or a file, facilitating debugging and network analysis.
